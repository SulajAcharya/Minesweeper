3. **Use Flags for Safety** 🚩: If you think there's a bomb lurking, **right-click** (or long press on mobile) to mark that square with a flag. It’s your way of saying, "I think this is dangerous!" But remember, too many flags might make things tricky...

4. **Winning the Game**: To win, you need to reveal all the non-bomb cells on the grid without triggering any mines. Can you clear the board safely? 🏆

5. **Mistakes Happen**: If you accidentally flag the wrong square, no problem! Just click it again to remove the flag.
